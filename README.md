This project is a full-stack blogging website created as a part of a LinkedIn Learning course. It serves as a practice project to enhance my skills in full-stack development. The website integrates a front-end built with React.js and a back-end developed using JavaScript and MongoDB, utilizing the MERN stack.

- User authentication and authorization
- CRUD operations for blog posts
- Responsive design

## Technologies Used
